## When, why and what should I use this?
You can use this prototype if you want to build a bitcoin, ethereum wallet. This application can be used as a demo
to show how the decentralized network or p2p application is working.

Blockchain is a public ledger, if you send bitcoin to a friend, the information is publicly available on the blockchain. Many people
see blockchain as an alternative to traditional banking. Instead of needing a bank or some other institution to verify
the transfer of money, you can use blockchain and eliminate the middle man.
